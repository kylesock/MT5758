Repository for the Data Analysis on Covid and Dietary data from 154 countries.

## Dimension Reduction
The beginning of the EDA looks to see correlations between the variables. Note the plot below uses red to illustrate negative correlations, and blue for positive correlations.

## Clustering Methods
Different cluster types could be investigated. Geographic ones may include continent, coastal, arid/tropical/tundra etc.. Whereas there could be more organisational focus on clusters such as EU members, NATO, or other multinational organisations. The plot below illustrates a density plot grouped by continent, for each variable. Note the x-axis shows the value, whilst the y-axis shows density, here meaning consistency of values amongst countries within a given continent.
